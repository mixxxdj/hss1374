/*! \mainpage HSS1394 Library
 *
 * \section intro_sec Introduction
 * HSS1394 is a library providing a cross-platform mechanism for reliable packet-based
 * communications services across the IEEE1394 bus. It was developed to provide a
 * high-speed transport for control data, bypassing the WMD and higher-level OSX protcol
 * stack for MIDI, thus delivering low latency high-bandwidth control information to and
 * from IEEE1394 devices; specifically the Stanton SCS.1D and SCS.1M devices.
 * 
 * This documentation describes the user calls into the HSS1394 library. The library
 * itself may be built using the supplied Win32 or OSX projects. 
 *
 * As a user, your starting point is the 'Node' singleton class which represents the local
 * node.
 *
 * \section include_sec Includes
 * To build a HSS1394 application, the user only need include HSS1394.h and be familiar
 * with this file and HSS1394Types.h. An illustration is provided in the file
 * TestHSS1394.cpp which will compile for both Win32 and OSX targets.
 *
 * \section install_sec Installation
 * To provide a linked library, the following files should be compiled and linked:
 * HSS1394.cpp, ConfigRom.cpp, 1394API.cpp and then either 1394API_VHPD1394.cpp (Win32
 * using Thesycon VHPD1394 driver interface) or 1394API_OSX.cpp (OSX IOKit interface).
